# Factbook

Factbook is a place where people can come to have civil discourse. The platform
is made with the express purpose of promoting level headed discussion that is
based on citations. As a community a consensus on the validity of citations is
formed and those that are considered the most factual are the ones promoted to
the top. Factbook aims to slow down the news cycle, placing a premium on
accuracy rather than speed. Opinions and free speech will still be allowed,
but it will not be amplified in the same magnitude that the factual items are.

# About the Stack

This is a project built with Typescript on both the client and server side.

# Working on The Project

### **Get the Code**

Clone the repository from Github

```git
git clone https://github.com/bennentterprise/factbook.git
```

### **Install The Dependencies**

Once you have the code project, you can run the typical install command
AND THEN the script that will automatically install client side dependencies.
(So the first command takes care of the server, Second takes care of client)

```bash
cd ./factbook
npm i
npm run install-client
```

### Run the Project
To run both the front and back end, you can use the script:

```bash
npm run dev
```
